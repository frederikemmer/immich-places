# Suggestions Feature

The `suggestions` feature provides location suggestions and recently used locations to quickly assign GPS coordinates while working in catalog/map workflows.

## Feature scope

- Build and rank suggestion categories from backend suggestion endpoints.
- Present suggestions as categorized pills with lazy-loading behavior for frequent locations.
- Offer recent-location shortcuts pulled from local storage history.
- Apply a chosen suggestion coordinate to the current selection with correct location source metadata.

## Files

- `useSuggestions.ts`
    - Fetches suggestion clusters from backend.
    - Scores and merges suggestion sources.
    - Builds categorized suggestion groups (suggested, album, same-day, two-day, weekly, frequent).
- `useSuggestionState.ts`
    - UI state derivation for suggestion tabs, counts, and frequent-load behavior.
    - Includes visual constants and stable cluster/category helpers.
- `useCatalogSuggestions.ts`
    - Connects selection + view context to catalog suggestions and selected album filtering.
- `SuggestionsPill.tsx`
    - Renders expandable suggestion categories and applies location selection.
- `RecentPill.tsx`
    - Renders recent suggestions from stored history and applies chosen coordinates.
- `SuggestionPanel.tsx`
    - Composes suggestion and recent pills and displays suggestion errors.
- `constant.ts`
    - Feature scoring and UI animation constants.

## Data flow

1. The catalog layer requests suggestions via `useCatalogSuggestions` based on current selection and album context.
2. `useSuggestions` calls the backend and transforms responses into grouped categories and suggestion clusters.
3. `useSuggestionState` composes UI categories, handles first-run lazy loading for frequent clusters, and computes visible counts.
4. `SuggestionsPill` and `RecentPill` render dropdowns and call `setLocationAction` with the selected suggestion coordinates and source enums.

## Notes

- Frequent-location clusters can be loaded on-demand when the suggestion panel opens.
- Recent locations are read from local storage-backed history and trimmed/validated before rendering.
