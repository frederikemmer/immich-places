# Filter Bar Feature

The `filterBar` feature contains the photo browser toolbar used to control catalog view and query state.

## What this feature does

- Synchronizes filter and view state with the URL so the browser state can be shared/restored.
- Provides controls for:
    - GPS coverage filter (`with-gps`, `no-gps`),
    - page size,
    - grid column count,
    - timeline/album mode toggle,
    - and manual sync with Immich.
- Displays contextual title and sync error information.
- Exposes reusable UI pieces and constants used by the filter area.

## Files in this directory

## State and URL flow

1. `useURLState` reads URL params on mount and subscribes to `popstate`.
2. Incoming query values are sanitized and validated before updating local state.
3. User interactions call update actions to change state.
4. `buildURLFromState` / `syncURLAction` produce and apply compact URLs
   (omitting defaults) for shareable, restorable filter state.
